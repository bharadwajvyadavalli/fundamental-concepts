# Fundamental Concepts

A comprehensive collection of interview preparation resources for Machine Learning Engineers, Data Scientists, and ML-focused Software Engineers.

## Repository Overview

This repository contains curated materials to help you prepare for various aspects of technical interviews in the ML/AI field, including system design, coding patterns, behavioral questions, and machine learning theory.

## Contents

### üèóÔ∏è System Design
- **System Design Guide.pdf**: Comprehensive guide for tackling system design interviews, covering architecture patterns, scalability considerations, and best practices for designing large-scale systems.

### üíª Coding Preparation
- **Mastering Coding Patterns.pdf**: Essential coding patterns and algorithms commonly tested in technical interviews, with detailed explanations and problem-solving strategies.

### üìù Behavioral Interview
- **Behavioral Interview STAR Method Guide.pdf**: Complete guide to the STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) method for answering behavioral questions effectively, with examples tailored for ML engineering roles.

### üß† Machine Learning Theory
- **Machine Learning Theory Questions.pdf**: Fundamental ML concepts, algorithms, and theoretical questions frequently asked in interviews, covering supervised/unsupervised learning, deep learning, and evaluation metrics.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Start with Assessment**: Identify which areas you need to focus on based on your target roles and current strengths.

2. **Structured Study Plan**: 
   - Begin with the System Design Guide if targeting senior roles
   - Review Coding Patterns for algorithm-heavy interviews
   - Practice STAR method responses for behavioral rounds
   - Master ML theory for technical deep-dives

3. **Active Practice**: Don't just read - practice implementing solutions, mock system designs, and rehearse behavioral responses.

4. **Mock Interviews**: Use these materials as the foundation for mock interview sessions with peers or mentors.

## Interview Preparation Tips

- **System Design**: Focus on trade-offs, scalability, and real-world constraints
- **Coding**: Practice pattern recognition and time/space complexity analysis
- **Behavioral**: Prepare 2-3 strong examples for common themes (leadership, conflict, failure)
- **ML Theory**: Understand both intuition and mathematical foundations
